            <p>When building systems, one of the most challenging aspects is designing for scale from the beginning. It's tempting to optimize for the current problem, but the best systems are those that can grow gracefully as complexity increases.</p>
            
            <h2>Start Simple, Think Complex</h2>
            <p>The paradox of scalable systems is that they often start with the simplest possible solution. The key is understanding which parts of your system will need to evolve and building flexibility into those areas while keeping everything else as straightforward as possible.</p>
            
            <h2>Embrace Modularity</h2>
            <p>Modular design isn't just about code organizationâ€”it's about creating systems where individual components can be understood, tested, and modified independently. This becomes crucial as your system grows beyond what any single person can hold in their head.</p>
            
            <h2>Plan for Failure</h2>
            <p>Scalable systems assume that components will fail. By designing for graceful degradation and recovery from the start, you create systems that become more robust as they grow, rather than more fragile.</p>
            
            <p>The best systems feel inevitable in retrospect, but that inevitability comes from careful thought about how complexity will emerge over time.</p>
